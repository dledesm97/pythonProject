This program will ask the user where they will be traveling to and then offer the option to 
be able to translate for them, get currency exchange information, can get the distance from 
one place to the other using latitude and longitude, or get quick facts about a country.

within them and most of the information included in this library is what is listed on Wikipedia and may
contain minor errors
